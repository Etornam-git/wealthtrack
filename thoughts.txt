if every user should have an account, then an account should have a value, meaning on every transaction, 
there's must be an effect on the account balance, for deposits,(+), for withdrawal,(-)

go to the accounts page , if no accounts, the account creation form
or if no accounts there's should be a button to add one

For the ;ist of transactions the user gets to select the view for a specified account
the transaction amount must be positive in all regards.
For deposits, the value must not be less than zero, same for withdrawals too
Also for withdrawals, the account balance must be more than the requested amount
.

Today
The user can't set the initial balance, default is 0
Complete and test CRUD on accounts.

Purpose of budget


Weâ€™ve agreed that the user should have full
control over their budgeting process in your app.
They will define their own income, set limits 
for each category (e.g., food, rent, transport),
and manage how they allocate their funds. 
The app will offer suggestions and structure
(like default categories and helpful tooltips),
but ultimately, the user decides what works best
for them. This ensures the budgeting experience
is personalized and flexible, allowing users 
to tailor it to their unique circumstances,
such as family size or lifestyle.
The app will track expenses and 
provide insights, but the user is
always in charge of their financial choices.

The user creates an account, perfoms a transaction;
each transaction can be optionally be tied to an account - Budget Assignment

Implementation:
When a transaction is performed and a budget is specified, the tracking should be such that,
 the budgetController gets the remaining amount, subtracts it from the limit set, for the progressbar, 
 it divides the remainig amount be the limit set by 100 //DONE

 Now every budget is tied to an account for better tracking.
  The budget limit cannot exceed the current account balance

Currently we're doing user profile with crud abilities, automated savings deductions(laravel tasks)
Leaving reviews by users = DONE
