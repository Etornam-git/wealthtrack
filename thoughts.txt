Purpose of budget


Weâ€™ve agreed that the user should have full
control over their budgeting process in your app.
They will define their own income, set limits 
for each category (e.g., food, rent, transport),
and manage how they allocate their funds. 
The app will offer suggestions and structure
(like default categories and helpful tooltips),
but ultimately, the user decides what works best
for them. This ensures the budgeting experience
is personalized and flexible, allowing users 
to tailor it to their unique circumstances,
such as family size or lifestyle.
The app will track expenses and 
provide insights, but the user is
always in charge of their financial choices.
